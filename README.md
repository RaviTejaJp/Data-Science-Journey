My learning path way to become Data Scientist

Hi Guys,

If you are starting with a aim to become <b>Data Scientist<b> the major confusion you will face is what is the path to follow.

Atleast that is what i faced. It took me a while to come out of that confusion.

After a lot of efforts i decided to follow the below road map. I just thought i will put it up so other who are starting might also
leverage it.

So according to me Data scientist job will be end to end.

That is
<h2>
  <b>
Collecting the required data ->   Storing the data ->   Retrieving thr data ->  Cleaning the data ->  Visualisation of the data -> Creating different models and evaluating them ->   Deploying the model ->  Looking how it is performing on real time data ->   If required make another model
</b>
</h2>
 

Obviously we need the Knowledge of the <b>Business domain</b> where we are trying to solve the problem to provide valuable insights.

As we already in a stage where most of the data is already collected I want to start my journey with Intresting topic called <h1>Machine Learning</h1>(As i already know python i am starting with Machine Learning)

For folks who does not know Python. Please check it out once it is very simple and powerful. With all the help that is available online for python you will love it.

Starting Machine Learning : I already has some experience in this area but still i would like to give a freash start to build strong foundation.
